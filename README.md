Parts list:

* 2x Star LEDs. I used 1W.
* 3x AA Batteries.
* [AA holder](https://www.digikey.se/product-detail/en/keystone-electronics/2464/36-2464-ND/303813). The case is designed to house this one, but it's got tolerance for other sizes.
* 1x 0.1uF capacitor.
* 1x Photosresistor
* 1x Resistor with a similar value as your photoresistor when dark. (I used 39k)
* 2x 56 Ohm resistors. You can use greater or smaller based on how quickly you want to drain the battery.
* 2x 1kOhm resistors (these are base resistors and should be based on your transistor)
* 2x BJTs or MOSFETs. They need to be rated high enough to handle the output current of your LEDs.
* 1x ATTINY13A microcontroller.
* Wires
* 3d printed parts (files are in the Assets directory)
* [Sparkfun mini perfboard](https://www.digikey.se/product-detail/en/sparkfun-electronics/PRT-08808/1568-1652-ND/7387401)

Optional:

* 1x DIP8 socket.
* 2x JST 2-pin connector pairs to turn on the LEDs. The case is designed for JST RCY.
